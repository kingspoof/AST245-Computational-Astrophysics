Here you can find a pdf with instructions regarding the first part of the N-body project, and the data (two formats: .ascii and .txt) you need to solve the task. You also find attached the original paper by L. Hernquist (1990).
The data file is made of a header and sequential arrays (each array has a single column data entry), as follows:
Header
Number of particles (N), Number of gas particles (N*=0 there is actually no gas-particle), Number of star particles
Arrays (running in i=1,...,N)
Masses[i]
x[i]
y[i]
z[i]
Vx[i]
Vy[i]
Vz[i]
softening[i]
potential[i]
Softening and potential are there just to keep a standard input/output. You should vary the softening when working on the project, but ignore the entry containing the potential.
